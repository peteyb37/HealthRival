You need to install NodeJs from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/ first to run the project

Then clone the project and open your favourite command line program to navigate to the project. Run npm install to install all dependecies

Then, you need to create a dev.js file in the config folder. In the dev.js, you must add the following text
module.exports = {
  hereAppId: '<ask-doanh>',
  hereAppCode: '<ask-doanh',
  sessionSecret: '<you can type anything you want here>'

  firebaseApiKey: '<ask-doanh>',
  firebaseAuthDomain: '<ask-doanh>',
  firebaseDataBaseURL: '<ask-doanh>',
  projectId: '<ask-doanh>',
  storageBucket: '<ask-doanh>',
  messagingSenderId: ''<ask-doanh>'
};

Then, npm run dev to start the app on http://localhost:7000

If you make change on the html and css file, it will auto update the style but if you made change on the js file and server side code you need to reload the page and login again. I am still working with the gulp building to fix it but it is low priority.

If you need to add a global css or js which used by all the pages for client side only, you should create a new file under views/css or views/js and then add the path to partials/styles.ejs or partials/scripts.ejs.
